The purpose of theses exercises is simple : resolve basic algorithm functions.

## <a name='steps'>🐨 Steps</a>

### 01 HowManyCamelCase

Create a function called howManyCamelCase that will take one string input str.<br />
We are given a sequence of words that are sandwiched together with no space.<br />
With the exception of the first word, in all of the subsequent words, the first letter of each word is capitalized.

The goal of the function is to output the number of words that are in the camelcase string. Let’s use an example:

### 02 Panagram

Create a function called IsAPangrams that will take one string, str as input.<br />
A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet.<br />
The goal of this function is to determine if the sentence given is a pangram or not.<br />

If it is not a pangram, the function will return false. If it is a pangram, the function will return true. Here is an example:

`"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`

In the example above,the function will return true.

`Hello Efrei`

In the example above,the function will return true.

### 03 Marsos

Create a function called marsos that will take in one string str as input.<br />
A spaceship is sent to Mars but crashes.<br />
It sends a series of “SOS” messages to Earth for help.<br />
Due to cosmic radiation, some of the “SOS” messages were altered during transmission.<br />

The goal of the function is to determine how many letters were altered during transmission.<br />

Exemple: for the input `SOFSOSSISSOW` the function will return 3
