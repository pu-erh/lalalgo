## <a name='overview'>ü¶ä Rules</a>

Hi, here are some rules to carry out this story oav;

- You **MUST** create a git repository named `cx-algo-oav1`
- You **MUST** create a file called `.author` with your firstname and lastname followed by a newline.
- You **MUST** create a file for each exercises **e01.js**, **e02.js**, etc

```sh
~/fp-exercises ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ cat -e .author
Majdi Toumi$
```

> Of course, you can talk about the subject with other developers, peer-learning is
> the key to be a better developer. Don't hesitate to ask questions or help people on slack.

> Don't forget, there is no useless question :-)

- You **MUST** return all exercises before Tuesday December, 15 at 16:00
- You **MUST** add `pu-erh` user as a collaborator.
- YOU **MUST** define all functions signature by yourself :)

The purpose of theses exercises is simple : resolve basic algorithm functions.

## <a name='steps'>üê® Steps</a>

### 01 HowManyCamelCase

Create a function called howManyCamelCase that will take one string input str.<br />
We are given a sequence of words that are sandwiched together with no space.<br />
With the exception of the first word, in all of the subsequent words, the first letter of each word is capitalized.

The goal of the function is to output the number of words that are in the camelcase string. Let‚Äôs use an example:

### 02 Panagram

Create a function called IsAPangrams that will take one string, str as input.<br />
A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet.<br />
The goal of this function is to determine if the sentence given is a pangram or not.<br />

If it is not a pangram, the function will return false. If it is a pangram, the function will return true. Here is an example:

`"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`

In the example above,the function will return true.

`Hello Efrei`

In the example above,the function will return true.

### 03 Marsos

Create a function called marsos that will take in one string str as input.<br />
A spaceship is sent to Mars but crashes.<br />
It sends a series of ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù messages to Earth for help.<br />
Due to cosmic radiation, some of the ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù messages were altered during transmission.<br />

The goal of the function is to determine how many letters were altered during transmission.<br />

Exemple: for the input `SOFSOSSISSOW` the function will return 3

### 04 Hello, Array

#### 4.1 Count

Create a function that take an array as an input and calculate the number of occurrences of a given element in an array.

#### 4.2 Average

Create a function that calculate the average of the elements of an array.

#### 4.3 Min

Create a function that calculate the minimum of the elements of an array.

#### 4.4 Max

Create a function that calculate the maximum of the elements of an array.

#### 4.5 Max

Create a function that calculate the maximum of the elements of an array.

#### 4.6 Shift

Create a function that shift the elements of an array.

#### 4.7 Diff

Create a function that calculates the largest deviation in an array (the deviation is the absolute value of the difference of two elements)
